The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Sunlight is made up of all the colors of the rainbow. As sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen). Rayleigh scattering refers to the scattering of electromagnetic radiation (of which visible light is a form) by particles of a much smaller wavelength. Shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (red and orange). Because blue light is scattered more effectively, it reaches our eyes from all directions, making the sky appear blue. Violet is scattered even more than blue, but our eyes are more sensitive to blue, and there is less violet in sunlight to begin with.
